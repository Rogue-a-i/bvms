BVMS corpus is an effort to extract Brazilian Portuguese article from the BVMS - Biblioteca Virtual em Sa√∫de. We aim to 
provide a corpus regardless the date, author, or any other metatag to be used by machine learning algorithms. The generated
dataset will be uploaded to the Huggingface platform. From there, we plan to create a Language Model from XLM-Roberta-Base
checkpoint.
